                    <h5 class="leading-xl">
                        Trained on high-quality datasets from UniProt, we developed a machine learning model named CLEAN (Contrastive Learningâ€“Enabled Enzyme Annotation) for enzyme function prediction. CLEAN takes an amino acid sequence as input and outputs a ranked list of predicted enzyme functions represented by Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers. Published in <a class="text-[#0080FF] underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2465">Science (2023)</a>, the CLEAN AI tool combines contrastive learning with pre-trained protein language models to achieve high accuracy predictions, even for enzymes with low sequence similarity to known proteins. CLEAN can confidently (i) annotate understudied enzymes, (ii) correct mislabeled enzymes, and (iii) identify promiscuous enzymes that possess multiple catalytic functions.
                    </h5>

                    <h5 class="leading-xl">
                        Built on top of this powerful tool, the CLEAN Database (CLEAN DB) is an open-access, comprehensive resource containing over 55 million enzyme function predictions and annotations. It offers a user-friendly platform for searching, browsing, and downloading annotations at scale. In addition to function predictions, CLEAN DB enables researchers to assess the effects of mutations using cutting-edge protein language models, making it a powerful tool for both computational and experimental enzyme discovery.
                    </h5>

                    <h5 class="leading-xl">
                        CLEAN DB supports a broad range of scientific applications, including enzyme engineering, synthetic biology, drug discovery, metabolic modeling, and functional genomics. Whether you're identifying candidate biocatalysts or studying the functional impact of mutations, CLEAN DB empowers you to extract meaningful insights from protein sequences at unprecedented scale and accuracy.
